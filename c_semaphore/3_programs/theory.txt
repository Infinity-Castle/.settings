Creating the Semaphore:
The semaphore is created using the semget() system call, which allocates a new semaphore set or obtains the identifier of an existing set.
The semaphore set is typically stored in the kernel's memory and is associated with a unique key.
Obtaining Access to the Semaphore:
Processes wishing to access the semaphore need to obtain its identifier using the semget() system call.
To access the semaphore, processes specify the same key used during its creation. This key serves as a unique identifier for the semaphore set.
Attaching to the Semaphore Set:
Once a process has obtained the semaphore identifier, it attaches to the semaphore set using the semop() system call or similar functions such as semctl().
Attaching to the semaphore set allows the process to perform semaphore operations such as wait() (P) and signal() (V) on individual semaphores within the set.
Semaphore Operations:
Processes perform semaphore operations (wait() and signal()) using the semop() system call.
These operations allow processes to acquire and release semaphores within the semaphore set, controlling access to shared resources or coordinating synchronization.
Synchronization:
Processes use semaphore operations to synchronize their access to shared resources or to coordinate their activities.
For example, a process may use a semaphore to ensure exclusive access to a critical section of code or to limit the number of processes accessing a resource concurrently.
Cleanup:
When processes no longer need access to the semaphore, they can detach from the semaphore set using the semctl() system call with the IPC_RMID command.
Once all processes have detached from the semaphore set, the kernel deallocates the associated resources.
