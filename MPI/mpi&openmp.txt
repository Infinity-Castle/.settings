OpenMP (Open Multi-Processing):
OpenMP is an API (Application Programming Interface) that supports shared memory multiprocessing programming in C, C++, and Fortran.
It allows developers to add parallelism to their code by annotating sections of code with compiler directives, such as #pragma omp.
OpenMP is typically used for parallelizing loops, sections of code, or tasks that can be executed independently.
It simplifies parallel programming by providing a high-level interface and is suitable for applications running on a single node with multiple cores.


MPI (Message Passing Interface):
MPI is a standard for message-passing parallel programming, used primarily in distributed-memory environments.
It enables communication and coordination among processes running on different nodes of a distributed computing system.
MPI allows developers to explicitly control data communication between processes using functions like MPI_Send and MPI_Recv.
It's commonly used for parallelizing applications across multiple nodes in high-performance computing (HPC) clusters or supercomputers.
Differences:

Programming Model:
OpenMP uses a shared memory model, where multiple threads share the same memory space and communicate through shared variables.
MPI uses a distributed memory model, where each process has its own memory space, and communication occurs through message passing.
Scope:
OpenMP is typically used for parallelizing code within a single node.
MPI is designed for parallelizing code across multiple nodes in a distributed environment.
Complexity:
OpenMP is generally considered easier to learn and use, especially for parallelizing simple loops or sections of code.
MPI offers more control and flexibility but can be more complex, especially for large-scale distributed applications.
