Pipes:
Description: Pipes provide a one-way communication channel between related processes, typically parent and child processes.
Advantages:
Simple to implement and use.
Low overhead.
Disadvantages:
Limited to communication between related processes.
Unidirectional (one process writes, the other reads).
Named Pipes (FIFOs):
Description: Named pipes are similar to pipes but exist as filesystem entries, allowing unrelated processes to communicate.
Advantages:
Allows communication between unrelated processes.
Simple to implement and use.
Disadvantages:
Unidirectional.
Limited to communication within a filesystem.
Message Queues:
Description: Message queues allow processes to communicate by sending and receiving messages, which are stored in a queue.
Advantages:
Supports bidirectional communication.
Messages can have different priorities.
Disadvantages:
More complex than pipes.
Limited to communication within a system.
Shared Memory:
Description: Shared memory allows multiple processes to share a region of memory, enabling fast communication.
Advantages:
Fastest IPC method as it avoids copying data.
Supports bidirectional communication.
Disadvantages:
Requires careful synchronization to avoid race conditions.
Limited to communication on the same system.
Sockets:
Description: Sockets provide a communication endpoint that allows processes to communicate over a network or locally.
Advantages:
Supports communication between processes on different systems.
Flexible and scalable.
Disadvantages:
More complex than other IPC methods.
Higher overhead compared to shared memory or pipes.
Signals:
Description: Signals are software interrupts that can be used to notify a process of an event.
Advantages:
Simple to use for event notification.
Asynchronous.
Disadvantages:
Limited data transfer capabilities.
Not suitable for large data transfers.
